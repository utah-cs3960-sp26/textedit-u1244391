Version 2.0.0
Added additional features

Dark Mode support: 
- Enable/Disable dark mode 
Inverts the colors for a more comfortable viewing experience. Had to continually remind the AI to make sure things were dark mode compatible because it sometimes forgot. 

File explorer
- Navigate through files and directories
- Open files for editing
- Create new files and directories
- Delete files and directories
- Can open and close projects from the file
This one was surprisingly easy and pretty much was done in one shot by the AI. It still only has basic functionality, but it's a good start. can be removed from the window and used all by itself in its own window which I thought was a cool idea. 

Split View
- Open multiple files side by side
- Navigate between files using tabs
- Split view can be toggled on and off
This one was harder as files would not be opened in the split view. The AI had to be reminded to open the files from the file explorer in the selected split view. It was a bit of a pain but it was worth it and it worked out fine. still cant figure out how to drag between split views which I think would be good but its not working yet.
